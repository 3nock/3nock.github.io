## Interactivity

The theme uses [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) for its interactive components, such as mobile navbar and notifications. If you want to add a new component through a pull request, then please use Alpine.js.

## Adding Scripts

There are two files within the includes directory called `head-scripts.html` and `footer-scripts.html`. These are empty files by default but allow you to add any additional JavaScript to your site, such as the script for AddThis share buttons, in the `<head>` or after the `<footer>` of the page.
