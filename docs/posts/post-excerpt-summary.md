By default, the blog page and the latest posts (in the sidebar) will use the automatically generated post excerpt. If you would like to override this you can set the summary in the post's front matter. The summary can be in markdown format if you like.

```yaml
layout: post
title: The post title
summary: |-
    This is the custom summary for the post.

    It can be in **Markdown format** if required.
```
