# About Me
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Hi, my name is Enock Nicholaus Michael. I am a graduate Molecular Biologist and a self taught software developer currently residing in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

I am very interested in writing software solutions that aid researchers in their work. 

I have recently developed a research grade software [Spider Suite](https://github.com/3nock/SpiderSuite) (An adavance web crawler/spider for cyber security professionals) and it is currently free and publicly available for download and use.

I contribute to many open source projects at my free time as I am a firm believer in open source softwares. I love to code in C++ and Python and i have authored many mini and big software projects in those languages though I am down to work with any programming language.

On my journey as a self-taught software developer i have picked up many invaluable skills and knowledge that has helped me grow as not only a reseacher but engineer.

`Bioinformatics`, `Cyber Security` and `Reverse Engineering` are my main field of work that i have spent years honing my skills in those areas. 

Besides work and studies, I love writing articles and blog post in my free time while listening to good music.

Please feel free to contact me for any inquiry.
